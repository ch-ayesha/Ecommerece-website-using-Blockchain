### Ecommerece-website-using-Blockchain
##Abstract
Our project is W3-Mart. It is an easy to use and intuitive online e-commerce website that
makes buying and selling easy and secure by combining normal e-commerce models with
the high levels of security and seamless transactions provided by blockchain technology.
It has three modules, the first for the seller to list items and their prices. The second
for customers to view and buy those items and the third for the admin to edit, add or
remove any item. It also has a built in loyalty system that rewards returning customers
for their patronage by providing them with sales and discounts along with payment
through crypto currencies instead of fiat currencies
##Introduction
E-commerce, also known as electronic commerce, allows businesses and consumers to
make online purchases. Many businesses and consumers find e-commerce to be more
efficient than brick-and-mortar stores. Businesses save on costs, and customers can select
from a wide variety of product choices and shop from anywhere in the world, at any time
of day. However, businesses need a platform to provide these e-commerce services from
where they can list their wares for sale and reach customers. They need a place where
people can come and view their items and buy them from the ease of their homes. But
for each business to make their own marketplace and introduce it to the public is a long
and difficult process. W3-Mart solves this problem by providing a reliable and easy to
use solution by combining both existing e-commerce models with the security of the new
and innovative blockchain technology. It becomes the platform where these businesses
can come to list their items for sale. It also acts as a central point for consumers to find
the product of they want without hassle and have it delivered to them. The customers
can browse or search items by categories making it easier for businesses to target specific
audiences. Loyalty programs, sponsored by retailers and other businesses, offer rewards,
discounts, and other special incentives as a way to attract and retain customers. They
are designed to encourage repeated business, offering people a reward for their continual
purchases. Typically, the more often a customer patronizes the merchant and the more
they spend the greater their rewards.
